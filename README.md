## TOML Support
At any given time `toml++` aims to implement whatever the [latest official TOML release](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/releases) is, with the addition
of 'unreleased' features from the [TOML master](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/README.md) and some sane cherry-picks from their
[issues list](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues) where the discussion strongly indicates inclusion in a near-future release.

### **ðŸ”¸Unreleased features and cherry-picks:**
- [#356](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/356): Allow leading zeros in the exponent part of a float
- [#516](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/516): Allow newlines and trailing commas in inline tables
- [#562](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/562): Allow hex floatingpoint values
- [#567](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/567): Clarify that control characters are not permitted in comments
- [#571](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/571): Allow raw tabs inside strings
- [#622](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/622): Add short escaping alias `\s` for space (`\u0020`)
- [#665](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/665): Make arrays heterogeneous
- [#671](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/671): Local time of day format should support `09:30` as opposed to `09:30:00`
- [#687](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/687): Relax bare key restrictions to allow additional unicode characters

These can be disabled (and thus strict TOML v0.5.0 compliance enforced) by specifying `TOML_STRICT = 1` (see Configuration and Usage).

### **ðŸ”¹[0.5.0](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/releases/tag/v0.5.0) and earlier:**
- All features as of _&lt;`toml++` release date&gt;_
